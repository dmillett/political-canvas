An *election* and *law authoring* Clojure(script) library designed to improve political elections and law creation for the 
US population. It will adhere to system and governance of laws in the United States that compliment the United 
States Constitution. The process aims to reduce disenfranchisement while educating and increasing participation of the
the people.

## Build Campaign
Create a framework that allows candidates to build a campaign for an election at any level. It should allow for easy 
campaign setup, social media feeds, candidate interaction with constituents/other candidates, and issues position matrix 
for all candidates. **This includes more in person events with constituents to foster empathy.** 
 
 * Create candidacy
 * Establish platform
 * Meet constituents
 * Campaign contributions limits ($1.00 - your time is worth more) 
 * Schedule Events
 * Social media feeds/API
 * Debate & Town Hall forums (in person/video/chat/etc)
 * Candidate position matrix
 * API to/from polling locations
 * Public API
 * Moderators to ~ensure fairness and non-intimidation
 
 *Explore blockchain for candidate positions and registered constituents*
 
### Getting Started
How a person starts building a campaign for a specific public role.

 * Determine position to run for

### Platform
 How to establish positions on common and uncommon topics within an electorate. Demonstrate
 support for/against policies and events.
 
### Informal Polling

### Debate Forums
A traditional or town hall style debate with all/most candidates with real/digital dialog.

### Financial & Volunteer Contributions
The digital age brings near ubiqitous communication that should not be influenced
by monetary donations. Therefore, monetary donations are limited to a small monetary 
amount that everyone can afford (ex: $1.00).

Time contributions are allowed.

## Craft Law
Create a simple, singly purposed law that provides letter of law, intent, and common 
examples on what the law includes or excludes. Allow for constituent polling of the 
law/etc before submitting to the appropriate governing body. 
 
 * Letter & intent of the Law
 * Contextual examples supporting the law (positive)
 * Contextual examples excluded by the law (negative)
 * Author(s) 
 * Immutable final/draft versions
 * Required Laws (depends on)
 * Related Laws (similar to)
 * Discussion and versioning forum
 * Shared polling
 * API to/from Governing Body(s) (House/Senate/etc) 
 * Public API

## Constituents
The voting populace for a given election district. To reduce fraud or abuse, the framework will attempt to validate 
Constituent location details. This is also useful for educating about local voter laws.  

* Voter ID (private data)
* Address (private data)
* Census
