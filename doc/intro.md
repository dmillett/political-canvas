# Introduction to political-canvas

**'Political Canvas'** is an idea of developing applications and framework for encouraging transparent and inexpensive participation in a democracy,
by: 
  1) making it easier and cheaper to campaign for a public office
  2) reducing campaign costs 
  3) facilitating communication between candidates and constituents (chat forums, town halls, etc) 
  4) educating constituents on candidate views, laws, bills, ordinances, etc; 
  5) to enable authoring of a new legal measure to be approved by the appropriate governing body.
 
I will spend time at night and weekends towards this goal and am a seasoned server side developer, but lack knowledge, skill set,
 and bandwidth to deliver a quality product within the next US election cycle.  Thus, I am hoping to collaborate with many others
 to discuss, develop, learn, and share practical ideas for facilitating inexpensive campaigns for all levels of political office.
